phpplaneta

==============================

This is the source code behind http://phpplaneta.net/ a web site dedicated
to the PHP community in Serbia and region.

It is built on top of the Zend Framework http://framework.zend.com/

The interface is in Serbian, but that shouldn't be a blocker, as the interface
isn't really complicated.

The source code, altho messy here and there, is in English.

Sorry for the lack of unit tests and comments :P

==============================
Install
==============================
Include the Zend Framework in the library directory, import the SQL files
from the db directory, change the application.ini in application/configs
directory, add writing permission for the web server on the data
directory and you should be good to go.

The contact page is using GMail's SMTP to send mails, so if you want
to use it too (with your own account of course), see the
application/modules/public/services/Contact.php file to setup things.
